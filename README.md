## AutoPAX100

This script reads the output from the band select pin of a Xiegu G90 and automatically sets the correct band on the PAX100 Low Pass Filter.  It also bypasses the amp when using bands there is no filter for.

It's been several months and two computers ago since I seriously worked on this.  Right now this is all on a breadboard.  The software seems to behave itself, once I have the hardware bugs worked out I'll add a schematic.
